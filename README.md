Mouf's Package Builder
=======================

This package contains a set of utility functions for Mouf to ease the way you can build packages.

Right now, it contains an export function to export instances easily (so you can build
installer with a large number of instances). The export function generates PHP code you can tweak later.

To access the export function, simply install this package and in Mouf UI, go in the 
*Utils* > *Package builder* > *Export instances* menu.
